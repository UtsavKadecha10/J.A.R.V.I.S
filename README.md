## Introduction 👨‍💻
It is a voice assistant which can be used to interact with your computer and also you have been seeing it in Iron man movies, but this JARVIS is not that much advanced as shown in movies. 

### Built with: Python<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/python/python.png" alt="Python" height="40" style="vertical-align:top">


## Cool functionalities of JARVIS 😎 :)

I have wrote code which you can use JARVIS in the following ways :

- It can open **Google** and perform Search operation
- It can send **emails**
- It can play **youtube songs**
- It can **download youtube songs** 
- It can tell **current time**
- It can tell **current day**
- It can **search in wikipedia** and tell about it in 5 lines
- It can **play music file** in a particular directory where the songs are present
- It can open **all the URL links**
- It can open/close **all the pc applications**(*NOTE*: give correct path based on your OS)
- It can **sleep until you say wake up**
- Finally It **can interact with you** and you can also add more commands if you want😎

> **NOTE:** Before running the code you must make sure you have all the modules installed in your python version(***NOTE:*** python version can be >=3.6).
